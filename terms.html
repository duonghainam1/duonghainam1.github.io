    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 24 June 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of These Terms</h2>
    <p>By accessing or using <strong>[App Name]</strong> (“the Service”), you agree to be bound by these Terms of
        Service (“Terms”) and our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree, please do not use the
        Service.</p>

    <h2>2. The Service</h2>
    <p>[App Name] is an automation workflow that uploads videos to TikTok on your behalf via the TikTok Content Posting
        API. The Service is <em>not</em> affiliated with or endorsed by TikTok Inc.</p>

    <h2>3. Eligibility & Accounts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You must be at least 18 years old and legally capable of entering into contracts.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any access tokens or OAuth credentials issued to
            you.</li>
        <li>You warrant that all videos, captions and metadata you submit comply with TikTok’s Community Guidelines and
            all applicable laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>We retain all rights, title and interest in the Service, including but not limited to source code, logos and
        trademarks. You retain ownership of the content you upload but grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive licence to
        transmit, process and store that content solely for operating the Service.</p>

    <h2>5. Prohibited Activities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reverse-engineering or interfering with the Service or TikTok’s API.</li>
        <li>Uploading content that is unlawful, infringing, defamatory, hateful or otherwise violative of TikTok
            policies.</li>
        <li>Selling or sublicensing the Service without prior written consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. API Rate Limits & Availability</h2>
    <p>The Service relies on TikTok’s API, which imposes rate limits (currently 1 000 uploads per app per day) and may
        experience downtime. We do not guarantee uninterrupted availability.</p>

    <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, express or implied. We
        disclaim all warranties including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.</p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special or
        consequential damages arising out of or related to your use of the Service—even if advised of the possibility of
        such damages. Our aggregate liability shall not exceed USD 100.</p>

    <h2>9. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access at any time, with or without notice, for any breach of these Terms or to
        comply with legal obligations.</p>

    <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, without regard to conflict-of-law
        principles. Any dispute shall be resolved by the competent courts of Ha Noi, Viet Nam.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be announced on this page at least 7 days
        before taking effect. Your continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.</p>

    <h2>12. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about these Terms, please contact us at <a href="mailto:[Contact Email]">[Contact
            Email]</a>.</p>
